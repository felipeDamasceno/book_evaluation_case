dales reading adds rich colors to so many characters that they become alive and quotjump out of the paperquot as a chinese saying goes out of all the media paper audio and movie of harry potter books i personally enjoy the audio the most i never read any harry potter until i started listening to book  by chance within  hour i was hooked try it', 'well if youre looking at this product youre probably like me busy and not the biggest fan of sitting down to read ive always been a big fan of stories but i could just never find the time to read because of work and when i did i am admittedly an abysmally slow reader after years of hearing how amazing these books the harry potter series were and loving every movie immensely it finally dawned on me to see if there was an audio book and there obviously iswhen i first started listening to the series i must admit i was a little turned off because stephen fray came across as a little dry and i was beginning to think the audio books werent going to be much more tolerable than simply reading the books as new characters are introduced though i was pleased to find that he managed to give most of them a unique personality and even more so that he maintains these personas not just through this single book but all the way to where i am now the half blood prince aside from just their vocal definition fry also manages to display a diverse range of emotion for each individual character as if there is a separate actor for each character its really quite an amazing performance in my opinion at certain times various audio filters are added for dramatic effect like echo and things of the sort and i guess thats really the only place this audio book comes up short for me is that there really isnt a whole lot to it other than stephen fry reading the books this being my first audio book i cant really compare it to anything but i guess i was expecting at least some music between chapters or maybe some ambient sound effects but i still find the overall experience enjoyable without themthere are probably hundreds of reviews for the books themselves so ill keep my opinions on the series short and sweet i believe the thing that i like most about the harry potter series is the overall charm of everything and the connection rawling maintains to both the real world and real life she really seems to nail human archetypes and the teenage inner dialogue and i cant help but think there are many pieces of her own children in this book it showcases such an amazing insight as to the way people think and feel that i really cant help but be awe inspired like i said though im not a big readerlistener so i imagine there are better books out there but that really doesnt take away from this series ability to crack a smile on my face at work i guess my only gripe is that it sometimes appears as if she has some favorite words or a limited vocabulary or perhaps people in england just find these words more common but there is an obtuse overuse of the words incredulous glower and one other that i will add in a couple of hours when i remember it this obviously isnt a big deal but it can make me cringe a littleanyways i work in science and listen to these all day when i dont have to read for work and im actually doing lab work and they have improved my enjoyment at work immensely so they come highly recommended by me each book is probably about  hours long off the top of my head so the whole series should take you a while to get through i hope you enjoy', 'well if youre looking at this product youre probably like me
